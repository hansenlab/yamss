Title: Tools for high-throughput metabolomics
Description: Tools to analyze and visualize high-throughput metabolomics data
    aquired using chromatography-mass spectrometry. These tools preprocess
    data in a way that enables reliable and powerful differential analysis. At the core of these methods is a peak detection phase that pools information across all samples simultaneously. This is in contrast to other methods that detect peaks in a sample-by-sample basis.
